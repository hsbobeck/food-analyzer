From a user-side process, the Food Analyzer first takes in a provided input image of a piece of food. It then interprets the image and provides back information of 1) the name of the food, 2) its current ripeness/predicted expiration, and 3) basic and nutritional info about the food. In order to achieve this final goal, we provide solutions for the following subproblems: first, to design and train a neural network to correctly identify food in an image. Second, to design and train individual neural networks to correctly predict food ripeness for a specific food. And third, to write a script to retrieve basic & nutritional information for a given food name. In this way, we approach the design structure of the project using a cascading style, in which the results for subproblems (2) and (3) above rely on the result from subproblem (1), the food recognition model. Through the efficacy of our resulting final product, we show that this method of combining cascading deep convolutional models and scripts into one fluid, intuitive user-side process is an effective approach for AI-based application development.
