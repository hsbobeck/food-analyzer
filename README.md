TO RUN: 

To run the user interface, run the python file food-analyzer/application/main.py. 

NECESSARY PREREQUISITE:

In order for our user interface to function, ensure first that the trained models are in the /models/ directory. If they are missing, they were likely too large to upload to the given hosting service and must be re-created using the .ipynb notebook files used for training in the /notebooks/ directory.
